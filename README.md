# COVID_19_analysis
Analysis of covid19 data just for the sake of knowledge 

This Coronavirus dashboard: the case of Sri Lanka provides an overview of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic for Sri Lanka. This dashboard is built with R using the R Makrdown framework and was adapted from this [dashboard](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/). The code behind this dashboard is available on (https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/coronavirus_dashboard) by Antoine Soetewey. I have made some changes to this code when I ran into some errors.
